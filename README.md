# Inception

This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in new personal virtual machine.

This project consists in having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different
services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You
have to use docker-compose.

You then have to set up:

â€¢ A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.

â€¢ A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and configured) only without nginx.

â€¢ A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.

â€¢ A volume that contains your WordPress database.

â€¢ A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.

â€¢ A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.

Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.
